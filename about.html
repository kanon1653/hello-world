    My interest in programming bloomed when I was in 4th grade. I started off by learning HTML to make my own website.

    Though I had been eager to study in the US, 2011 Tohoku Earthquake urged this motive even more. I realized I need to help out Japan by receiving education from the US where the technology is developping rapidly.

  <p class = "about-text">
    I left my home when I was in 7th grade, entering Rumsey Hall School in Connecticut. Then, I went to Choate Rosemary Hall, enhancing my skills in math and programming skills. Here, I learned Java and took an individual course to master HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

  <p class = "about-text">
    I was then accepted to Carnegie Mellon University, currently studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. By taking both hardware and software courses, I can feel myself building my strength in many programming languages and computer algorithms.
